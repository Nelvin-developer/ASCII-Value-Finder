# ASCII Value Finder in Java

This is a simple Java program that finds and displays the **ASCII value** of a given character.

## 💡 Overview
In this program, the user enters a single character, and the program outputs its corresponding ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) value.  
This is a basic concept in Java that demonstrates character and integer data type conversions.

## 🧰 Features
- Takes a character as input.
- Prints its ASCII value.
- Demonstrates type casting between `char` and `int`.

## 🧠 Example Output
Enter a character: A
The ASCII value of A is: 65


## 📜 Code Explanation
- The program uses a `Scanner` to take user input.
- It stores the character in a variable of type `char`.
- It converts the `char` to `int` to get the ASCII value.
- Finally, it prints the result.
